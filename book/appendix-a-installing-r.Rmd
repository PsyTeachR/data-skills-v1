# Installing `R` {#installing-r}

## Why should I install R on my computer?

The R Server cuts down on a lot of installation problems and it means that you have all the packages and functions you need already installed. However, it requires an internet connection to use and additional when it comes time to submit your R assessments, if you don't have R on your computer it means that you won't be able to open the files you download from the server to check they're ok before you submit them.

There are some great detailed walkthrough videos by [Danielle Narvarro on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRPB0ZzEYegOZivdelOuEn-R-XUN-DOjd) re: how to install R on both Windows and Mac.

## Windows

If you are using Windows, you should download and install the following:

* [R](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)
* [R Studio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
* [RTools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)

Once you've installed all three programs, restart your computer. Then, open RStudio (not R) and run the below code:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

This will install the `tidyverse` package on your computer. If you have any problems installing R, please book into a GTA session as they should be able to help you with any installation problems.

## Mac

If you are using a Mac, you should download and install the following:

* [R](https://www.stats.bris.ac.uk/R/)  
* [R Studio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)  
* [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/)  

If you have any issues installing R on your Mac, first, we recommend that you watch the [walkthrough by Danielle Navarro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ay25o485YXs&list=PLRPB0ZzEYegOZivdelOuEn-R-XUN-DOjd&index=1&t=113s). 

If you have further issues on Mac, you may find this video helpful [walkthrough video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90IdULVGmYY). Additionally, if you are using a Mac with the Catalina OS, we also recommend you read this [troubleshooting guide](https://psyteachr.github.io/FAQ/installing-r-and-rstudio.html#i-am-using-macos-10.15-catalina)

Once you've installed all three programs, restart your computer. Then, open RStudio (not R) and run the below code:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

This will install the `tidyverse` package on your computer. If you have any problems installing R, please book into a GTA session as they should be able to help you with any installation problems.

## Chromebooks

Please note that you cannot currently install R on a Chromebook, please use the R Server.
## RStudio Settings

There are a few settings you should fix immediately after updating RStudio. Go to **`Global Options...`** under the **`Tools`** menu (&#8984;,), and in the General tab, uncheck the box that says **`Restore .RData into workspace at startup`**.  If you keep things around in your workspace, things will get messy, and unexpected things will happen. You should always start with a clear workspace. This also means that you never want to save your workspace when you exit, so set this to **`Never`**. The only thing you want to save are your scripts.

You may also want to change the appearance of your code. Different fonts and themes can sometimes help with visual difficulties or [dyslexia](https://datacarpentry.org/blog/2017/09/coding-and-dyslexia){target="_blank"}. 

```{r settings-general, eval = TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "RStudio General and Appearance settings"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/rstudio_settings_general_appearance.png')
```

You may also want to change the settings in the Code tab. Foe example, Lisa prefers two spaces instead of tabs for my code and likes to be able to see the `r glossary("whitespace")` characters. But these are all a matter of personal preference.

```{r settings-code, eval = TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = 'RStudio Code settings'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rstudio_settings_code.png")
```


## Installing LaTeX

You can install the LaTeX typesetting system to produce PDF reports from RStudio. Without this additional installation, you will be able to produce reports in HTML but not PDF. This course will not require you to make PDFs. To generate PDF reports, you will additionally need to install `r pkg("tinytex")` [@R-tinytex] and run the following code:

```{r eval=FALSE}
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```
